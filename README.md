## 📱 Mobile Customization & Responsiveness

- The carousels and all sections use responsive Tailwind CSS classes.
- Carousel containers use `h-[350px] sm:h-[500px]` for compact mobile height.
- Carousel cards use `w-[220px] h-[300px]` on mobile, `w-[300px] h-[400px]` on desktop.
- Overlay paddings and margins are reduced for mobile (`p-2`, `mx-1`).
- Navigation, section paddings, and negative margins are all responsive (e.g., `py-4`, `md:py-16`, `-mt-40 md:-mt-80`).
- To customize for mobile, use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`) in your component classes.

**Example:**
```jsx
<div className="-mt-40 md:-mt-80"> ... </div>
```

## 🛠️ How to Update Team Members and Gallery

- **Team Members:**
  - Edit `app/data/teamMembers.ts` to add, remove, or update team members.
  - Each member has a `name`, `role`, and `image` field.
  - Images should be placed in the `public/` directory and referenced by their path (e.g., `/team.jpg`).
- **Gallery Images:**
  - Edit the `galleryImages` array in `GalleryCarousel.tsx` to update images and captions.

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Desktop (1200px+)
